# OOP coaching

The aim of this repository is to provide a coaching material about Object Oriented Programming.

Though this examples should be used from «students» itself, they are tailor-made to an agile technical coaching approach.

## About this repo

The repo is made using C# language on dotnet 6+.

The `main` branch intentionally contains a **procedural code**, that is not respecting any of the OOP patterns.

The `steps/*` branches contains the refactored code, each step has the explanation and an example of a «feature» of OOP language.

Steps are subsequent: step 2 starts from step 1 and so on.

### Example

* `steps/01_object_and_classes` contains the procedural code, but moved to a separate classes
* `steps/02_data_abstraction` contains the `steps/01` code, but with a better data abstraction
* ...
* last step contains the fully refactored code, using all OOP functionalities
